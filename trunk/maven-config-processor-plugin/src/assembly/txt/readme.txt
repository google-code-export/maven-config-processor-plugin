Config Processor, version ${project.version}
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

The Config Processor applies transformations to configuration files to prepare
them for different environments.
It tries to implement the same ideas implemented by XConf
(http://xconf.sourceforge.net), but does it more easily integrated with Maven
and using standard ways of processing XML (using XPath) and includes better
support for properties files processing.

Please, see the maven generated site by opening the docs/site/index.html file
in your browser for examples of use with Maven 2 and Ant.
